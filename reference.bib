  abstract = {In neural networks literature, there is a strong interest in identifying and defining activation functions which can improve neural network performance. In recent years there has been a renovated interest in the scientific community in investigating activation functions which can be trained during the learning process, usually referred to as trainable, learnable or adaptable activation functions. They appear to lead to better network performance. Diverse and heterogeneous models of trainable activation function have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we present a survey of these models. Starting from a discussion on the use of the term ‘‘activation function’’ in literature, we propose a taxonomy of trainable activation functions, highlight common and distinctive proprieties of recent and past models, and discuss main advantages and limitations of this type of approach. We show that many of the proposed approaches are equivalent to adding neuron layers which use fixed (non-trainable) activation functions and some simple local rule that constrains the corresponding weight layers.},

These series arise in two-dimensional scattering problems on diffraction gratings with multiple inclusions per unit cell. It is shown that the Schlömilch series involving Hankel functions or Neumann functions can be expressed as an absolutely converging series of elementary functions and a finite sum of Lerch transcendent functions, while the Schlömilch series of Bessel functions can be transformed into a finite sum of elementary functions. The closed-form expressions for the Coates's integrals of integer order have also been found. The derived equations have been verified numerically and their accuracy and efficiency has been demonstrated.},

A key ingredient in many of these extensions is an appropriate addition theorem: a coherent, thorough exposition of these theorems is given, and computational and numerical issues around them are explored. The application of these methods to different types of problems is also explained; in particular, sound waves, electromagnetic radiation, waves in solids and water waves. A comprehensive bibliography of some 1400 items rounds off the book, which will be an essential reference on the topic for applied mathematicians, physicists and engineers.},

Here, the optical theorem is extended and generalized in a cylindrical coordinates system for the case of 2D beams of arbitrary character as opposed to plane waves of infinite extent. The case of scalar monochromatic acoustical wavefronts is considered, and generalized analytical expressions for the extinction, absorption and scattering cross-sections are derived and extended in the framework of the scalar resonance scattering theory. The analysis reveals the presence of an interference scattering cross-section term describing the interaction between the diffracted Franz waves with the resonance elastic waves. The extended optical theorem in cylindrical coordinates is applicable to any object of arbitrary geometry in 2D located arbitrarily in the beam’s path. Related investigations in optics, acoustics and quantum mechanics will benefit from this analysis in the context of wave scattering theory and other phenomena closely connected to it, such as the multiple scattering by a cloud of particles, as well as the resulting radiation force and torque.},

  abstract = {A classical problem of free-space Green’s function G0 representations of the Helmholtz equation is studied in various quasi-periodic cases, i.e., when an underlying periodicity is imposed in less dimensions than is the dimension of an embedding space. Exponentially convergent series for the free-space quasiperiodic G0 and for the expansion coefficients DL of G0 in the basis of regular (cylindrical in two dimensions and spherical in three dimension (3D)) waves, or lattice sums, are reviewed and new results for the case of a one-dimensional (1D) periodicity in 3D are derived. From a mathematical point of view, a derivation of exponentially convergent representations for Schlo¨milch series of cylindrical and spherical Hankel functions of any integer order is accomplished. Exponentially convergent series for G0 and lattice sums DL hold for any value of the Bloch momentum and allow G0 to be efficiently evaluated also in the periodicity plane. The quasi-periodic Green’s functions of the Laplace equation are obtained from the corresponding representations of G0 of the Helmholtz equation by taking the limit of the wave vector magnitude going to zero. The derivation of relevant results in the case of a 1D periodicity in 3D highlights the common part which is universally applicable to any of remaining quasiperiodic cases. The results obtained can be useful for the numerical solution of boundary integral equations for potential flows in fluid mechanics, remote sensing of periodic surfaces, periodic gratings, and infinite arrays of resonators coupled to a waveguide, in many contexts of simulating systems of charged particles, in molecular dynamics, for the description of quasi-periodic arrays of point interactions in quantum mechanics, and in various ab initio firstprinciple multiple-scattering theories for the analysis of diffraction of classical and quantum waves.},

The study is based on the analytical solution of multiple scattering, where incident and scattered waves are expressed in cylindrical harmonics. This modeling leads to dense linear systems, which are made sparse by introducing a cutoff radius around each particle. This cutoff radius is deeply studied and quantified. Numerical resolution is performed using parallel computing methods designed to solve very large sparse linear systems. Comparisons with direct calculations made with another numerical software and homogenization techniques follow and show good agreement with the implemented method. The last part is dedicated to a comparison between the propagation of waves in a circular cluster made of a random distribution of cylinders and the propagation in the corresponding homogenized cluster where the multiple scattering formalism is combined with a statistical analysis to provide an effective medium.},

  abstract = {In this work multiple scattering by an array of perforated cylindrical shells with a porous core has been investigated. A semi-analytical model to predict scattering from such cylindrical units is presented in the context of the multiple scattering theory (MST), and validated against laboratory experiments. The suggested semi-analytical multiple scattering model uses an impedance expression to include the perforated shell in the scattering coefficients, which is a compact way to describe a composite scatterer in MST. Calculation results of a small array are shown to be in excellent agreement with measured data. Predictions and data show that perforated cylinders with empty cavities exhibit a strong and narrow insertion loss peak at resonance, though simultaneously suffer from amplification below resonance. By adding porous material in the core of the scatterer adverse effects below the resonance peak were suppressed. In addition, it was found that the reduction peak broadens, though at a cost of a reduced peak amplitude. Finally, it has been shown that adding porous material in a perforated shell will introduce partial absorption of the incoming field, which can be optimized by adjusting the perforation ratio of the shell.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Graphene's unique physical and chemical properties make it an attractive platform for use in micro- and nanoelectronic devices. However, electrostatically controlling the flow of electrons in graphene can be challenging as a result of Klein tunneling, where electrons normally incident to a one-dimensional potential barrier of height               V               are perfectly transmitted even as               V               → ∞. In this study, theoretical and numerical calculations predict that the transmission probability for an electron wave normally incident to a one-dimensional array of localized scatterers can be significantly less than unity when the electron wavelength is smaller than the spacing between scatterers. In effect, placing periodic openings throughout a potential barrier can, somewhat counterintuitively, decrease transmission in graphene. Our results suggest that electrostatic potentials with spatial variations on the order of the electron wavelength can suppress Klein tunneling and could find applications in developing graphene electronic devices.},

  abstract = {An efficient method to calculate the lattice sums is presented for a one-dimensional (1-D) periodic array of line sources. The method is based on the recurrence relations for Hankel functions and the Fourier integral representation of the zeroth-order Hankel function. The lattice sums of arbitrary high order are then expressed by an integral of elementary functions, which is easily computed using a simple scheme of numerical integration. The calculated lattice sums are used to evaluate the free-space periodic Green’s function. The numerical results show that the proposed method provides a highly accurate evaluation of the Green’s function with far less computation time, even when the observation point is located near the plane of the array.},
